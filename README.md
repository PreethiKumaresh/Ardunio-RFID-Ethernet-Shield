# Automation of Lab System Allocation 
# Overview:
Nowadays, RFID tags are extensively used in many applications like school/college attendance, inventory management, to identify food contamination, tracking system etc. such as in the retail store, educational and business sectors. RFID is a small wireless tag that help to identify objects and people. These tags do not require a battery to power up and in turn, they derive power from the electromagnetic field generated from the RFID reader with the help of Arduino Uno. Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on ATmega328 that is mainly capable of running one program at a time, over and over again. The objective of this project is to create an application that helps to manage the lab security also system allocation in terms of the problems like device theft, physical damage to hardware and also to keep track of the list of persons utilizing the lab. Thus, in the proposed system with the help of RFID tag that is present in studentâ€™s ID card can be used for tracking the check in/out of each person using RFID reader integrated into Arduino
Uno board. The information is updated in the database and analyzed for future use.
